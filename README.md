This is a little Zig library that provides a function to calculate the
[_abjad_ numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad_numerals) value of a
string of Arabic-script text. A few options can be configured: Mashriqi vs.
Maghribi letter order, whether to count an _alif madda_ as one or two *alif*s,
etc. The logic is based on implementations that I've written in other languages,
including [TypeScript](https://github.com/theodore-s-beers/abjadcalc) and
[Rust](https://github.com/theodore-s-beers/abjad-rs).

I hope to add more documentation here later. For the time being, it may be
instructive to review the notes on my site
[abjadcalc.com](https://www.abjadcalc.com/).
